<p>Alright, Lets talk about the elephant in the room first - This seems to be a personal website from the name and URL, so what’s a number doing in my name? Well, my last name is Baviskar. ‘Bavis’ in my mothertongue (Marathi) means 22. Hence, Baviskar = 22kar. <br />
I remember I came up with it when I was a kid and it felt veryy creative (at that time it did xO) and then it got stuck with me like a tattoo.</p>

<p>Alright, now then... Hi! Welcome to my personal site. Let me start with answering the usual questions first - </p>

<h2 id="how-am-i-doing">How am I doing?</h2>
<div class="content-section">

  <div class="hidden-content">
    <p><div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="15238441" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.78771" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/im-fine-little-boy-crying-gif-15238441">Im Fine Little Boy GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/im+fine-gifs">Im Fine GIFs</a></div>

<h2 id="why-did-i-make-this-website">Why did I make this website?</h2>
<p>Well…</p>
<ol>
  <li>Firstly, it had been in my woah-that-is-so-coool-I-wanna-have-it list from a while.</li>
  <li>And secondly, I had been gravely away from myself for a while and making this website, designing it, curating the things I like and I create, I thought was a good way to rediscover and remind myself who I am. So, here it is - tadaa!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="where-am-i-based-out-out-of">Where am I from?</h2>
<p>I am from and currently based in Mumbai, India.</p>

<h2 id="living">What do I do for living?</h2>
<p>Currently looking for a role as CFD / Thermal / Aerodynamics / Simulation / Application engineer (Know someone who has a similar role? Get in touch with me!)</p>

<h2 id="physical-features">What are my physical features? (for strange reasons if you wanna know)</h2>
<p>I weigh 202 kg on Jupiter and I am 0.001366 miles tall.</p>

<h2 id="languages-i-speak">Languages I speak -</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>English -</strong> Not that great vocabulary though (which I believe, can be good for writing sometimes. Yes, you read that right - good)</li>
  <li><strong>French -</strong> Oui, mais je suis encore un debutant </li>
  <li><strong>Marathi -</strong> Because its my mothertongue</li>
  <li><strong>Hindi -</strong> Because its the common tongue of India</li>
  <li><strong>Gujarati -</strong> "Savaar-savaar ma mharo magaj ni kharab karta tame! Chal fafda khai le..." </li>
  <li><strong>Math -</strong> Just at an intermediate level. Its mind-blowing and mind-boggling!</li>
  <li><strong>Music -</strong> Oooofff… where do I even begin. Let me just share a song with you - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVcZfQe-Kw">guess?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Bookish -</strong> “Yes, Bookish” assured Jay nodding his head as he imagined the confused face of the reader while reading this. “Don’t you know Bookish!? The language novels speak?” asked Jay enthusiastically.</li>
  <li><strong>Actions -</strong> Well, this one’s tricky. I can be quite fluent at it one day and completely forget it the other; it's hard to practice. Secondly, you rarely come across people who speak it.</li>
</ul>

<h2> My hobbies and interests - </h2>
<p>I loved Science and Math when I was a kid. It fascinated me! I am grateful for my mother that she let me buy all the story books related to scientists, inventors and mathematicians (I can still remember the scenes I imagined as a kid when I read them). My love for them obviously transformed into love for Physics, which got transformed to mechanics/mechanical engineering eventually finding my core niche as Heat and mass transfer and computer simulations now, professionally.</p>

<p>Personally, I have a lot of other diverse interests -</p>

<p>I’ve realised that it’s not something that I absolutely love, but <strong>I am good at table tennis</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>I have recently started loving films</strong> actually. Or now that I think, I have started appreciating the art in them, because again, I have started understanding art more in itself.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I like philosophy (atleast, anymore) but <strong>I am a philosophical man</strong>. I do ask a lot of questions, but asking them for 25 years and going mad, a chapter from a book made my realise that it’s important to ask the right questions. It’s another thing that I still ask wrong questions though (inserts Captain America: I can do this all day gif*)</p>

<p><strong>I love psychology!</strong> I can get pretty obsessed with it sometimes, a behavior which I am not a fan of.</p>

<p><strong>I have taken quite some liking to literature</strong>, especially flash fiction and short stories. I like to make lists of books I wanna read instead of actually reading them - it’s one my guilty pleasures. Also, I think I am too dumb for poems, but I absolutey love poetic things!</p>

<p><strong>I love music (and music composition)!</strong> What’s my genre? None and all! I do have special place for western classical, but otherwise, I like good music. A good music is like truth - noone can deny the feeling in it. Also, did I mention I attended a Hans Zimmer concert in 2023? Abso-fucking-lutely surreal!</p>

<p><strong>I have started loving to create content.</strong> I first had the taste of it when I made a blog on Mechanical/Aerospace engineering and a YouTube channel associated with it almost a decade ago (links below).<br>
It was a shame that such a dynamic subject was taught using words. I liked explaining things and I also wanted to make some money. I took some inspiration and help from my seniors and there it was - MechStuff, my baby! I pour my heart in creating content and I am super proud of some of the articles and tutorials I created; and trust me dear friend - seeing your article or video ranking 1st on Google page is a feeling nothing less than of an orgasm. <br> 

But I have had some rough years recently and so now, I wanna create some personal content - about me, my thoughts, my feelings and emotions, my humor, my insights and whatever other nouns I can’t think of right now. Although a bit slow, I am glad that it has begun. This website is a proof :)</p>
