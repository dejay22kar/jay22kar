<h1 style="text-align: center;">Clair de lone</h1>

It was one of those long narrow streets and it was night. I was alone, but not lone.    
All the wooden shops on both the sides were closed. There was no source of light, except the moonlight. 

As I walked on that narrow street, I kept wanting to walk more. But as I reached the end of the street, I looked back again and I could see only 2 colours - the darkness and the moonlight.

I came back again to the centre, not wanting this moment to end. 
As the rays of moonlight fell on the roofs, I could see the stardust vaporising off the surface towards the sky. It was all glittering my dear friend. 

Was the stardust white? Or was it blue? It was white and blue. 
Exactly like the moon and the moonlight - the moon bright white yet the moonlight seeming so blue. 

The mind inside the dream me, made that sparkling and twinkling sound. 
“That’s how it sounds in the movies!”, thought the dream me. 

I saw myself in the centre of the street, my moonlit face, so blank and so awed, 
as I saw this whole surreal, mystical land evaporating except me, so odd. 

There were no people, as were no thoughts. 
Forget thinking, I wasn’t even feeling - neither my breaths nor my feet on the ground, I was completely lost. 

I was not me. 
I was those wooden shops, that cobbled street, that shimmering stardust, that moon and that moonlight and that is why I still know them so well. 

I was alone, but not lone. 
I experienced Clair de lone.
