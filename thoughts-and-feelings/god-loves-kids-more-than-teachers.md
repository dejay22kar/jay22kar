<h1 style="text-align: center;">God loves kids more than teachers</h1>

<p>It’s monsoon. It’s the period after recess. You’ve got lethargic because of all the delicious food you’ve had, not from your own, but from others’ tiffin boxes. You are out of luck, because it's X teacher's lecture and staying awake during her lectures is as difficult as qualifying Olympics. Her voice itself adds something to the air that induces drowsiness to the whole classroom. You turn around to check up on your mates only to find Avinash Bej is already asleep (Sorry, couldn’t resist :P). There’s a flash followed by a thunder rumbling. You look outside through the window, it’s getting dark. You can’t complain <em>yet</em>. You say to yourself - "You don’t have to care, don’t have to listen, just keep your eyes open", <em>until...</em> it starts raining. Indeed we’re so lucky to have a classroom besides the shed! The raindrops have started tapping against the plastic shed. “We can’t hear you” some students complain. The teacher is adamant, she moves towards the centre of the classroom speaking more loudly. But naa, God loved kids more than teachers. He poured in all He had, making the shed clatter and roar even more loudly. You haven’t paid attention to a single sentence she has said in the last 15 mins but you join the protest yelling “Still can’t hear you, teacher!” She gives up. Receding back to her desk, she gives you a free period. </p>

<p>Folding your arms on the desk, you glance at the person you’re “kinda” attracted to for a second (they must be sleepy as well, you think), and finally rest your head. Smelling that familiar wooden smell as you shove yourself upto the point where your nose touches the desk, you go to sleep. 
You realise you were never so thankful to God before! God acknowledged it.</p>

I swear to god, staying awake during X teacher's lectures has to be one of the hardest things one has to do


<p>He went on further to cut the power supply off, which was his way of saying “Have a good nap”. He smiled but you’re already asleep. The universe smiled.</p>
