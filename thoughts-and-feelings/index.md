Welcome dear human! <br>   

Although not many and I think I have just gotten my feet wet in literature, I wanted a place where I could have my writing all in one place (other than my notes app) and also a platform so that I could share with anyone if I ever wanted to. So here it is.

I am planning to share some of my ideas and thoughts in form of blogs, and my feelings in the form of short stories or flash fiction or as I majorly prefer to call it - pieces of text. It's because I just write anything that comes to me and quite often I don't like or care or even understand how to classify them. Hence, I just call them pieces.

Times are a quite unstable, so they would come out slow but yes, I want to put it out all eventually. I would list all of them here below so you could directly jump on anything that you are curious enough to read. <br> 
Happy reading!
