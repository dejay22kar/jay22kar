<h1 style="text-align: center;">The One Element</h1>

You are water.   
Upon which I am steering and sailing my life,   
No matter where and in what direction I look, like water, you are everywhere.   
Upon those huge merciless waves of emotions, maybe I’ll reach nowhere.   
That which keeps me afloat and wrecks, you are that water.    

You are the air and the sky.    
I turn back and smile with a relief, that, I am finally going away from you,   
Then, my smile instantly fades away from my face as I look up ahead,   
To find out that I am only getting closer to you.       
That which keeps me alive, yes, you are that air.  

You are earth.   
It’s been a while floating and drifting in this ocean of space and time,   
And searching for you, wanting to be with you is far more astronomical than a distant dream.   
That known yet unreachable piece of land, you are that earth.   

You are fire.    
The fire inside me, that fuels my mind relentlessly haranguing with questions of you,   
The burn inside my chest of being separated by so many “issues”.   
That fire, even extinguishable by other elements, you are that fire. 

You are ether.       
The fundamental space that exists in, around, above, between and comprising all the things, everywhere;    
And also that void from which all my creativity emerges,   
You are that void that has left me empty, yet has filled me with you.   
That paradoxical and intangible element, you are that ether.    

The world is made of all these five elements,    
But not mine, mine is made up of you.
