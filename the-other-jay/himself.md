<h1 style="text-align: center;">Himself</h1>

I’m lost   
Never seen this neighbourhood before,    
So does it matter if I keep walking anymore?

Anyways, I felt like you said that I could stop here,   
Away from all the people, no one can see   
You seem big enough, where I can hide and no one could seek me

Will I be ever as wise as you?   
Will I ever grow as big as you?   
Will I ever say someone to stop by just like you did to me? 
  
I feel like I’ve found you,   
now that I’ve found you,   
I have come here to pour   
You were here long before & you will stay forever more       
You are my witness and I know you could never lie       
So when I’ll go away,   
and if someday someone asks,   
Could you tell them? 

That the tears were real, they were indeed real!   
And if that’s the case, my pain was real.   
Perhaps it was inessential,   
perhaps I was responsible,   
perhaps the thoughts were unreal,   
but the misery was real. 

Tell them that he came here,   
And he went on.   
Even though lost,   
he went on to his destiny.   
Where? Little did he know that it didn’t matter,   
Because he didn’t know that all the roads led to Himself.
