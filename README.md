## [Thoughts](https://dejay22kar.github.io/jay22kar/thoughts) | [Music](https://dejay22kar.github.io/jay22kar/music) | [Games](https://dejay22kar.github.io/jay22kar/games) | [The other Jay](https://dejay22kar.github.io/jay22kar/jay222kar)

Alright, Lets talk about the elephant in the room first - This seems to be a personal website from the name and URL, so what's a number doing in my name? Well, my last name is Baviskar. 'Bavis' in my mothertongue (Marathi) means 22. Hence, Baviskar = 22kar. 

I remember I came up with it when I was a kid and it felt veryy creative (at that time it did xO) and then it got stuck with me like a tattoo. 
PS: I abso-fucking-lutely hate it whenever I try making my account on a new website and cannot use _jay22kar_ as my username, like who in the world is as stupidly obsessed as me having the same username -_-

## How am I doing?

## Languages I speak - 
- **English -** Not that great vocabulary though (which I believe, can be good for writing at times. Yes, you read that right - good)
- **French -** Oui, mais je suis encore un debutant :P
- **Marathi -** Because its my mothertongue
- **Hindi -** Because its the common tongue of India
- **Swedish -** I know enough Swedish to say - I don't speak Swedish
- **Math -** Just at an intermediate level. But hey, I can teach you the basics in almost no time! (I mean, if you're interested in learning, it's beautiful!) 
- **Music -** Oooofff... where do I even begin. Better I just share a song with you - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVcZfQe-Kw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVcZfQe-Kw) (come on, get on your feet already!)
- **Bookish -** "Yes, Bookish" assured Jay nodding his head as he imagined the confused face of the reader while reading this. "Don't you like Bookish? The language novels speak?" asked Jay enthusiastically.
- **Actions -** Well, this one's tricky. I can be quite fluent at it one day and completely forget it the other. Its hard to practice you know. Secondly, you rarely come across people who speak it.
