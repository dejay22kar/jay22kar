Hello! Here are some photos that I have taken in my life. I do sometimes wish that I had that perspective of a photographer that I do not possess and I am not sure why do I **not** have a very strong motivation to learn it. Hence, I take photos purely guided by intuition. 90% of the photos are taken from my phone. I have tried my best to organise them. Hope some of the photos will make you feel something ðŸ™‚

Here are some photos that I have taken in and from my room in Gothenburg, Sweden, over the time. I lived in this house when I was going through the worst (and 'metamorphosis' stage) of my life and it has gave me a safe space to be and feel anything, anytime. Naturally, I have grown to be very fond and attached to it and perhaps this is my humble way to capture it, to keep it with me, in the form of photos. I will forever be grateful to universe for this house, this room - Room 1514.
