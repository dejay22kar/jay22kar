<h1 style="text-align: center;">A tree</h1>

Not the biggest or the tallest in the forest, 
But I want to be a tree 

I want the birds build nest on me, sing on me, squirrels chirp on me,
But first, I need to be a tree

I want the kids to climb and swing on me,
But first, I need to be a tree 

I want to provide shadow to yatree*,
But first, I need to be a tree

I want to share the fruits not only with humans but also with pashu & pranee*, 
But first, to bear them, I need to be a tree
 
I’ll giveaway my trunk when I’ll be free, 
But first, I need to be a tree

Sometimes I feel that others should water me, 
So that I will grow fast into a tree,
But then you can always grow your roots deeper to grow into a tree

And sometimes you’ll be cutdown while becoming a tree, 
But you can always start again to become a tree

I often forget, it takes time to become a tree,
I am a plant and I want to be a tree... I want to be a tree!
