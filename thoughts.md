# One Line-years
It was November 2024 and it randomly came upto me and it suddenly struck to me 'Damn... 2025 is already here. I've been through sooo much this year, I wonder if I could put it one line?'. Then I was curious how many years can I describe in one line and here we go

 - 2025 - Loading...
 - 2024 - The year of anxiety and learning discomforting and painful truths about myself.
 - 2023 - The year of grief. And sadness. And denial. And chronic loneliness and overwhelmingness, shame, stress, fear, trauma, anxiety, lots of pain, darkness and... death.
