# ðŸŽ¥ Films and TV shows

Here are some of the my favorite movies and TV shows. Screen productions that provided me some value. Some of them offered incredible story, some goosebumps, some offered a punch at the end, some an edge of the seat thrill, some were just cinematic masterpieces - their camera movements, shots, transitions, an unprecedented way of showing stories visually, and some... just emotions - pure raw emotions which didn't just touch me, it moved me to the bone and pierced through my heart through-and-through like a nice sharp and sleek Japanese katana sword.
