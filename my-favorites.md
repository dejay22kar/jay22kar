Here are some of the my favorite movies and TV shows. Screen productions that provided me some value. Some of them offered incredible story, some goosebumps, some offered a punch at the end, some an edge of the seat thrill, some were just cinematic masterpieces - their camera movements, shots, transitions, an unprecedented way of showing stories visually, and some... just emotions - pure raw emotions which didn't just touch me, it moved me to the bone and pierced through my heart through-and-through like a nice sharp and sleek Japanese katana.
