You send your best predator to kill the best in us?    
Shame on you! 

You kill the person who saved the other?   
Shame on you!

You offer him misery for the love he offered?   
Shame on you! 
 
You don’t make them enough tall,    
who helped the other make it across the wall?   
Shame on you!

You make some of us so helpless,   
that we have to pay to someone just to get things off chest?   
Shame on you!

You let those monsters “perform” their monstrosity,   
leaving the victims with lifetime of anxiety?   
Shame on you!

Look at you, standing over there,    
shamelessly smiling while I reveal all your dirty secrets     
Shame on you!

Don’t you have any shame?   
When a person is seeking help from you, begging you,   
and you still stand there smiling? 

What are you smiling at?   
Who do you think you are Life?  
Mona Lisa? “Life” a wonderful, enigmatic piece of art?   
Sadness, secrets, beauty behind your smile? 

Don’t ask me who am I to judge you,   
Just another product of your injustice and unkindness who is accusing you

No. Who do you think you are?   

Smiling like a God. But are you?   
If you were,   
would you just stand still and smile when one is choking in front of you?  

Your smile is not that of “You’re missing the bigger picture, my innocent!”   
Your smirk is that of  “I know I am the villain!”
 
Walking my way away from you now, I think -   
So ironic, isn’t it?  
After stripping you almost naked,   
You still stand there undefeated

While me, I weep,   
I see, stripped off all my identity, ambitions and present,   
This, this is my walk of atonement!

Looking at me now,   
I can hear all the others saying -   
Shame on you!
