I was 15. I had this new feeling. Very unsettling, uncomfortable, didn't know what to call it, how to describe it. It was there when I was alone and it was also there when I was part of people standing in a circle having chips and chatting. Somehow this feeling always made me feel different, separating me from others. 

That year was the first winter I felt. As if, there was no winter for the first 14 years of my life. I remember my dry knuckles and the Nivea cream and its very diffusive smell, the full shirt and the earmuffs I wore. The only time when I felt warm and comfortable was when I pressed that huge round power button on the CPU, and the monitor turned on with a Lamborghini wallpaper and I played NFS Most Wanted on my computer even though it lagged - lagged as the government. 

I had recently started watching Vh1 on TV and it had become my favorite channel! This song I came across, never really understood it because I could never make out the words, and used to listen to English songs only because it made me feel inclusive in my circle, or made me look cool in front of other people (since the majority listened to Bollywood). I loved that song! It went like -  beat-clap; beat-beat-clap; and again, beat-clap; beat-beat-clap. I put it on loop! Every time I found myself alone on the way back home, I played it. Something resonated. It made me feel better, or perhaps comfortable is a more appropriate word. Yes, it made this uncomfortable feeling comfortable, more managable, like a bed acts for a sick person.

Fast forward a few years and then I realised why I loved that song, what did it say, what I felt, what is that uneasy, resisting, wanting-to-escape feeling called. 

The song was -

Then fast forward more years and I understood why I felt the way I felt.
