<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Rope</h1>
<hr style="border: 0; height: 1px; background: #2b2b2b; margin: 25px 0;">

Between being kind to people and    
them taking advantage of it,   
I’m caught in the middle

Between my desires and   
my needs,   
I’m caught in the middle 

Between my loneliness and    
my social anxiety,    
I’m caught in the middle 

Between this relentless mind and   
the exhausted body,   
I’m caught in the middle

Between being with 'them’ in fiction and   
their absence in reality,   
I’m caught in the middle 

Between million thoughts and thousands of words to say    
and saying none to anyone,   
I’m caught in the middle 

Between reminding myself the past to learn from it and   
forgetting it to move on,    
I’m caught in the middle 

Between being wanting to do better and   
not being able to do it,    
I’m caught in the middle

Between distracting myself to do something else   
just to face those thoughts anyways at night,    
I’m caught in the middle 

Between those troubled thoughts while I am free and    
keeping myself busy to the point of burning out,    
I’m caught in the middle

Between sobbing “It happened with me!!”    
and Accepting “Yes, it happened with me”,   
I’m caught in the middle 

Somewhere between dying and living,    
I’m caught in the middle 

In this game of tug of war,    
Who am I?    
Between the winning and the losing side,   
Who am I?

I’m that thing which is caught in the middle,   
I am the rope. 

No matter who wins,    
I have to endure.    
Who am I, again?   
I am Suffering.
