A certain kind of shiver ran down his whole body just as he finished reading the sentence. Before a lightning could strike, before a housefly would take off, before he could even blink, almost instantly, a thought took over him. He raised his head up and was now staring in the air with his pupils out of focus. The most jolly little golden retriever puppy passed by him. So jovial, it could easily grab anyone’s attention bringing a smile on their face, especially his! But no, his eyes wide open were closed for everything else. The book lay on his left palm, with the fingers of his right hand gently pressing down on the open pages to keep them from fluttering. He was so still gazing into nothingness, one would wonder if he was even breathing. His eyes about to leak, he tried to gulp down the lump he had in his throat, submerge it. But it didn’t, the lump resurfaced. Just like an inflatable ball which resurfaces up with far more force than it was being held underneath the water, the lump resurfaced. It bounced back. It said, 

“Love”
